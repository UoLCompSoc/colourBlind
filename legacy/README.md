What is this?
=============

This folder contains legacy files which aren't used directly in the game, but nevertheless form a part of its history and deserved to be saved.

These files are removed from the rest of the project to:
 - Clean it up, and
 - Ensure they don't get bundled with the android/assets folder and increase the size of the distributed file.
